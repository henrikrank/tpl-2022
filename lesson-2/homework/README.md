# Homework for 22.09 and 29.09
Creating your first webpage.

## Creating a cool website about a subject you like
Create a website about you or a subject you really like. Make sure it has different components, such as images, different styles of text, colors.
Play around with divs and putting text and image content into different "boxes" to create cool visuals.

If you want inspiration, use the code in [lesson-2/jimi-hendrix](https://github.com/henrikrank/tpl-2022/tree/main/lesson-2/homework/jimi-hendrix) as a boilerplate. It's okay to copy some code from over there, or maybe just a couple of elements. 
Mainly, I want you to play around with different **HTML and CSS** elements. Try out lists, links, buttons, whatever we have done in the previous lessons. Put divs in divs, go crazy. It doesn't have to be anything super fancy, but the cooler it looks, the better the **wow-effect**.

You can refer to the Jimi Hendrix project or the Tea project for inspiration (but the Tea one is a bit boring, though it has nice buttons and stuff). The website I made about Jimi Hendrix is a showcase of different types of stuff you can do with `<div>`'s and can give some inspiration.

> If you want to use Google Fonts (because Times New Roman is boring), check out [How to use Google Fonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JR6mEWEEo&ab_channel=DevSprout). I recommend Montserrat!

Bring some progress to the lesson on 22.09 and submit on 29.09. In October, we will be working with JavaScript, so it's a nice wrap-up of what we have been doing.

Mainly, I want you to have fun, and go at your own pace. **And remember, the more you code, the better you will become at it**. There are 0 shortcuts to mastery, just putting in the work and mindfully learn. **Google is your nr. 1 friend**.
