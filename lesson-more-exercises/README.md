# Speedrunning JS Exercises
Get better at JavaScript by solving these exercises. They are very common exercises, so you can practice your skills and get better at JavaScript. As õp Küüsmaa says, you need to drill-drill-drill to get better at anything.

> These are extracts from an online tutor who does great JS exercises. If you want a step-by-step guide to solving them in a fancy way, check out [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N65RvNkZFGE&list=PLpc_YvcwbxaSn6jn0VaTcG8A0Grgs1GSB&index=1&ab_channel=codebubb). However, the tutor uses a more complex syntax than what we are used to.
