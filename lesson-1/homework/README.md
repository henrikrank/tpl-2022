# Homework for Lesson 1

* Make a GitHub account (you're in GH right now)
* Download [VSCode]('https://code.visualstudio.com/Download')
* Install VSCode
* Create a project folder where you store all your code on your computer
> It's nice if you upload the code to GitHub or Google Docs later, just in case something happens with your machine
* Copy the contents of lesson_1/lesson_code (will update ASAP) to your project folder and run the HTML file in your browser.
* Join our Messenger group (important announcements and general help goes there)
* Bring your computer to the classroom next time
