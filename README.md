# Extra: Don't stop here!
## Practise everywhere on the go
If you want to become a really good developer, you need to put in the effort. That means studying various topics, and practising-practising-practising. You can only get good at anything in life if you continuously practise. Be hands on and get to work!

## Best way to become a good developer
1. Find a project you really want to make (personal website, calorie calculator, friend's birthday card etc) and with this goal in mind, start googling how to build it.
2. Code the damn thing. Make it PRETTY!
3. Show it off to your peers!
4. ...
5. REPEAT!
